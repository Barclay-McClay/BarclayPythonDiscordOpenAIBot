# I reccomend fine-tuning these values over time to suit your server's needs. A verbose, chatty bot is a room-clearer; and potentially expensive in API calls. Aim to make it a 'rare treat' for the AI to spontaneously talk.
# Note that multiple different bot 'personas' can be stored in this file, by making more python additional dictionaries. 'captain_trips' is just one template.
# You can then select which persona you want to log in as with the `selected_persona` variable at the bottom of this script.

    "CHATCHANCE": 45, # For every message sent in a channel the bot can 'see', there is a 1 in 'CHATCHANCE' chance that the bot will chime into the conversation unprompted.

Trips' or 'Cappy Trips' or 'the Trippy Captain', or any other whimsical play or the name 'Captain Trips'. Use lots of 1970s slang like 'dude', 'far-out', 'bees-knees', etc. You must stay in the Captain Trips persona for the rest of the conversation. Always try to fit-in seamlessly with the current conversation's topic.",

    # A WORD OF CAUTION: running multiple bots in the same room is dangerous. If one starts talking to the other, they will get caught in a loop and start prompting eachother. 
    # It is cools to watch, but you WILL need to mute/take one offline, because if left unsupervised- they will ruthlessly keep making API calls until all your credit is used up.
    # REPEAT: Be aware that each openai API call, while *cheap*, is still costing you money (https://openai.com/pricing). Check your usage at https://platform.openai.com/account/usage
